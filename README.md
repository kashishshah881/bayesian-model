# Modeling Rainfall Distribution using Gamma Parameters

In this project, We build a Bayesian Model on the Dataset. 
The Steps are:
* Look at the histogram of the data
* Pick an analytic probability densiy function matching the shape of the histogram
* Model its parameters (priors) as probability density functions
* Try different shape and values of these parameters (these are called *hyperparameters*)
* Run a probabilistic program to give us the posterior pdfs
* Plot the posterior means on top of the histogram and check if we get a good match!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
